    <p>Built with Python, Flask & a little ❤️</p>

  <p>
    ShopFlask is a fully-featured ecommerce platform built as a learning project using
    <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>, and <strong>uv</strong> for dependency management.
    It demonstrates a real-world application structure with authentication, shopping cart, checkout,
    order management, and Stripe payment integration hooks.
